FIRST CHALLENGE

All 3 questions can be executed as a normal python file, using "python <file>" in the terminal:
"python Lists.py" will run the Lists question.
"python Functions.py" will run the Functions question.
"python Classes.py" will run the Classes question.

None of the programs need external libraries, but Question 1.3 was tested using Jupyter Notebooks in VSCODE and saved in the file "Classes.ipynb", it is not needed to run it, but to do so the packages inside the "requirements.txt" file must be installed, but all the 3 python files can be ran without any requirements, besides python, installed.

Inside the 1.3 challenge the Methods and Class names were mantained, but all the new ones were named following the PEP8 style, which means methods should be named as lowercase with underscore to improve readability.
for example: the method check_fuel_by_price(self, price).
